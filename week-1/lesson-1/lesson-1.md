# Setup and Rendering with React

## Overview

React is a library for performing efficient updates to a web page; a process referred to as ```rendering```. To use React, the author describes how a given application state should be displayed and React takes care of manipulating the browser's ```DOM``` to match that state. This removes the error-prone process of manually updating parts of the DOM when your application state changes. With React, you merely render **everything** again, and React makes sure only to make the minimal changes necessary.

## One-Way vs. Two-Way Data Flow

In contrast with other tools that also help with DOM manipulation, such as Angular, React embraces the concept of **one-way data flow**. This means when using React, the view is generated by React, but does not communicate directly back to it. Instead, actions generated by your views such as clicks and key presses must go through an intermediate layer which React calls the ```dispatcher```. This dispatcher decides how to interpret the action and what changes, if any, should be made to your application ```state```. React documentation refers to the ```state``` of your application as the ```store```.

React does not have an opinion on what dispatcher and store you should use, it only provides the capability to convert your ```state``` into updates for the browser. You can write your own dispatcher and store, or use one of the many options available as open source projects. In this course, you will start off writing your own and then transition into using **Redux**.

## Virtual DOM

React makes certain the ```render``` function's output is what the page actually contains. This may involve adding elements, removing elements, or updating elements in-place. These are the kind of operations traditionally jQuery is used for. Unfortunately, making updates to the DOM can be slow, and multiple unnecessary updates can severely impact the responsiveness of a site, especially as the number of updates grows. This was one of the driving factors for motivating Facebook to develop **React**. With React they were able to minimize the amount of updates being performed and bring the performance of the page back to a reasonable point.

To build up a minimal list of operations to be performed on the DOM, React needs to be able to compare what is currently in the DOM to what should be there. To support this, the ```render``` function does not output HTML or make changes to the DOM directly. Instead, it outputs a data structure known as a **Virtual DOM**. This virtual version of the DOM is greatly simplified and very fast to work with. React then checks the virtual DOM against the real DOM in the browser and makes a list of updates to perform. Since DOM manipulation is a slow process, this ensures only elements genuinely changed are updated. There are many Virtual DOM based systems available in the JavaScript ecosystem, but **React** is by far the most commonly used.
