# Setup and Rendering with React

## Overview

React is a library for performing efficient updates to a web page; a process referred to as ```rendering```. To use React, the author describes how a given application state should be displayed and React takes care of manipulating the browser's ```DOM``` to match that state. This removes the error-prone process of manually updating parts of the DOM when your application state changes. With React, you merely render **everything** again, and React makes sure only to make the minimal changes necessary.
